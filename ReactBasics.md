# What is a component

- A **component** is a piece of UI you cab reuse. 

Everything in react is considered to be a component. 

- React components are required to begin with an upper case letter.

  function Header() {
    return (
      <header>
        <h1>Scoreboard</h1>
        <span className="stats">Players: 1</span>
      </header>
    );
  }
```
