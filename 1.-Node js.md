# Node.js basics


## What is Node.js
Asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime designed to build scalable network applications.

#### What is an application?

An applcation is a computer program with an interface, such as an interactive display for the user to accomplish tasks like word processing or making spreadsheets.

#### What is a network application?

A network application uses the client-server architeture, which at a bird eyes view means there could be two or more computers involved in handling data.


#### Javascript Runtime 

A program that executes instructions while running. JavaScript Runtime is a runtime implemented in JavaScript code.

#### Event Driven

A program follows the flow of events determined by a user.
  - Process file
  - retirieve a file
  - Retrieve multiple files

#### Asynchronous Operations

An asynchronous program will allow operations to continue simultaneously meaninf while an operation is executing, it can start new ones without blocking the old operation.

#### Sunchronous Operations

A synchronous applications handles operations sequentially.
